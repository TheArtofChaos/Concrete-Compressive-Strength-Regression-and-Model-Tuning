# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Regression-and-Model-Tuning

Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset: This dataset contains 1,030 instances with 8 features related to the components of concrete mixtures and the compressive strength of the concrete. The task can be to predict the compressive strength based on the features, which is a regression problem.

*Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction*

This project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on various features related to concrete mixtures. Using a variety of regression techniques including Random Forest and Decision Tree regressors, the code employs hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance. Multiple data scaling methods are applied to enhance the model's predictive capability. The goal is to provide accurate predictions for concrete compressive strength in real-world scenarios.
